# Wildcard: VR and Eye-tracking for Attention Training in NDD

## Overview
Wildcard is a Virtual Reality (VR) application designed to enhance attention skills in individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD). This project leverages eye-tracking technology and immersive VR experiences to provide engaging and effective attention training exercises.

## Key Features
- **Immersive VR Environment**: Utilizes the Pico Neo3 Pro Eye headset for a fully immersive experience
- **Eye-tracking Integration**: Precisely tracks user focus and attention
- **Multiple Training Activities**: Includes Research, Story, and Exploration exercises
- **Customizable Experiences**: Different stories and scenarios to maintain engagement
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate visual and auditory cues to guide users

## Technical Details
- **VR Platform**: Developed for Pico Neo3 Pro Eye
- **Interaction** Methods: Combines gaze, controller pointing, and button presses
- **Unity Integration**: Built using the Unity game engine
- **Data Collection**: Records performance metrics for analysis

## Research Findings
- **Usability**: Achieved an average SUS score of 80.26, indicating good usability
- **Performance**: Observed consistent improvement in task completion times across sessions
- **Visual Attention**: Demonstrated improvement in Trail Making Test (TMT) scores for most participants
